I wanted to take a simple app I'd built in HTML (https://github.com/gitberry/StudyMobileFirst-1-HTMLPlain) and see how this might translate to vuejs.   

It is now a SPA (Single Page Application) - and I put it on my shared hosting account site - all by itself at (https://kristi.northberry.com) - but things not yet solved are:

#Routes - one can't hit kristi.northberry.com/stop1 directly - I need to navigate to it from kristi.northberry.com - which makes it not work for my use case.  More research needed - this must be a configuration issue - perhaps a shared hosting service provider issue...

#subfolder - I would have preferred to put this in a subfolder like https://northberry.ca/kristi - and I was able to get some of the functionality working - and I know it's possible based on the searches  made.

NEXT - use an API to dynamically provide the data - then we'll be cooking with gas!!
